Abstract

   NETCONF and RESTCONF protocols provide programmatic operation
   interfaces for accessing configuration data modeled by YANG.  This
   document defines the use of YANG-based configuration template
   mechanism so that the configuration data could be defined as template
   and applied repeatedly to avoid the redundant definition of identical
   Configuration and ensure consistency of it.

1.  Introduction

   It is not unusual for the YANG data model [RFC7950] to define some
   shared profiles that could be referenced in order to simplify the
   configuration of network services or functionalities.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit] defines a set of profiles at
   the network level which could be referred to under the node level to
   factorize some common configuration shared by a group of attachment
   circuits (ACs).

   However, it is not trivial to always take care of the definition of
   shared profiles/ policies/templates during the design of every data
   model.  There is a desire to make use of common YANG-based templates
   without relying on specific definition in YANG data models.

   NMDA [RFC8342] allows the configuration templates to be defined in
   <running> and expanded in <intended>, but it does not specify details
   about how configuration templates could be created and applied.

   This document defines the use of configuration templates in the
   context of YANG-driven network management protocols such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  By defining a common set of nodes
   as a configuration template and applying the configuration template
   repeatedly, it avoids the redundant definition of identical
   configuration and also ensures consistency of it.  Configuration
   template could be used based on any existing YANG data models, this
   document doesn't make any assumption on the YANG data model design,
   i.e., it does not rely on the shared profile/group defined in the
   YANG data model.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The meanings of the symbols in tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340].

   This document uses the YANG terminology defined in Section 3 of
   [RFC7950].

   Besides, this document defines the following terminology:

   configuration template:  A chunk of reusable configuration data that
      could be applied to the configuration repeatedly, in order to
      simplify the delivery of network configuration and ensure the
      consistency of it.  A configuration template can also be called
      "hierarchical template", or "template" for short.

   inherited template:  A configuration template that is applied in the
      configuration data tree or reused by other templates.

   parent template:  A configuration template that is an inherited
      template.

3.  Hierarchical Template Overview

   A configuration template must first be defined before it can be
   inherited Section 4.  The creation, modification, and deletion of
   configuration templates are achieved by network management operations
   via NETCONF or RESTCONF protocols.  The content of the configuration
   template must be an instantiated chunk of data starting from at least
   one top-level node in the module hierarchies.

   For example, Figure 1 provides an interface configuration template
   that sets "mtu" as 1500 for ethernet interfaces:

   <templates>
     <template>
       <id>interface-type-mtu</id>
       <interfaces>
         <interface>
           <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
           <mtu>1500</mtu>
           <description>MTU value is set by template</description>
         </interface>
       </interfaces>
     </template>
   </templates>

                 Figure 1: Example of An Interface template

   The YANG data model of configuration templates is defined in
   Section 8.

3.1.  Validity of Templates

   The contents of the template alone is not always sufficient to
   enforce the constraints of the data model.  Some constraints may
   depend on configuration outside of the templates to satisfy, e.g., a
   list may contain a mandatory leaf node which is not defined in the
   template but explicitly provided by the client.  However, servers
   should parse the template and enforce the constraints if it is
   possible during the processing of template creation, e.g., servers
   may validate type constraints for the leaf, including those defined
   in the type's "range", "length", and "pattern" properties.

   That said, if a template is applied in the configuration data tree,
   the results of the template configuration merging with configuration
   explicitly provided by the client MUST always be valid, as defined in
   Section 8.1 of [RFC7950].

4.  Inheriting Templates

   This document allows configuration templates to be inherited by top-
   level configuration nodes in the data tree or new templates.  A node
   inherits at most one configuration template.

   If a configuration template is inherited by a node in the data tree,
   it acts as if the configuration defined in the template is contained
   and is merged with the configuration provided explicitly at the
   corresponding level in the data tree with the explicitly provided
   configuration takes precedence.

   If a configuration template is inherited by another new template, the
   configuration of the new template is the merging result of
   configuration defined in both templates with the new template takes
   precedence over its parent template.  This is useful when some
   additional configuration is intended to be defined on the basis of
   the parent template.

   Any modification to the parent template also applies somewhere
   inherits the template.  Care MUST be taken when making changes to the
   parent templates.

4.1.  The "stmt-extend" Metadata

   Template inheritance is flagged by declaring the metadata object
   called "stmt-extend".

   If the template is inherited by a top-level node in the data tree,
   the metadata object is added to that specific node.  Server MUST
   igore any metadata objects added to the node that is not a top-level
   node.

   If the template is inherited by other templates, the metadata object
   is added to the top-level node of the template contents.

   The "stmt-extend" metadata MUST have only one value to specify the
   parent template identifier that is inherited.  The encoding of "stmt-
   extend" metadata object follows the way defined in Section 5 of
   [RFC7952].

   For example, a client may configure physically present interfaces
   "eth0" and "eth1" with the container node "interfaces" inheriting the
   template defined in Figure 1:

  <interfaces xmlns:template="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-template"
    template:stmt-extend="interface-type-mtu">
    <interface>
      <name>eth0</name>
    </interface>
    <interface>
      <name>eth1</name>
    </interface>
  </interfaces>

   And the above interface configuration is equivalent to the following:

   <interfaces>
     <interface>
       <name>eth0</name>
       <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
       <mtu>1500</mtu>
       <description>MTU value is set by template</description>
     </interface>
     <interface>
       <name>eth1</name>
       <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
       <mtu>1500</mtu>
       <description>MTU value is set by template</description>
     </interface>
   </interfaces>

4.2.  Template Extension

   If there is some further configuration data that needs to be created
   but not included in the parent template, it can be provided at the
   corresponding level when inheriting the configuration template.  For
   example, the client may want to define another template and provide
   an additional "enabled" leaf value on the basis of template defined
   in Figure 1:

<templates>
  <template>
    <id>interface-type-mtu-enabled</id>
    <interfaces xmlns:template="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-template"
      template:stmt-extend="interface-type-mtu">
      <interface>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </interface>
    </interfaces>
  </template>
</templates>

   And the above interface configuration defined in the template
   "interface-type-mtu-enabled" is equivalent to the following:

   <interfaces>
     <interface>
       <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
       <mtu>1500</mtu>
       <description>MTU value is set by template</description>
       <enabled>true</enabled>
     </interface>
   </interfaces>

   Appendix A.2 provides more examples of inheriting an existing
   template by indicating the "stmt-extend" metadata object.

5.  Overriding Templates

   It may be desired to override some configuration in an existing
   template when it is interited.  This may be achieved by directly
   editing the configuration template that is inherited, however, the
   parent template may have also been inherited by other instance nodes
   or templates, and direct modification of the parent template may
   yield unexpected results.

   This document allows a configuration template to be overridden by
   other templates or configuration explicitly provided by the client.

5.1.  Modification

   If there is some configuration values that need to be modified, the
   desired value can be provided at the corresponding level when
   inheriting the configuation template.

   For example, a client may configure physically present interfaces
   "eth0" and "eth1" inheriting the template defined in Figure 1, but
   the "mtu" value of "eth1" needs to be 9122, and the "description"
   value also needs to be modified accordingly:

  <interfaces xmlns:template="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-template"
    template:stmt-extend="interface-type-mtu">
    <interface>
      <name>eth0</name>
    </interface>
    <interface>
      <name>eth1</name>
      <mtu>9122</mtu>
      <description>MTU value is set explicitly</description>
    </interface>
  </interfaces>

5.2.  Deletion

   The deletion of configuration data is flagged by declaring the
   metadata object called "operation-tag" with a value "delete".  If
   some node instance defined in the configuration template is intended
   to be deleted in the configuration explicitly by the client or by new
   templates, the metadata object is added to that specific node.
   Servers MUST ignore this metadata if the configuration identified
   currently does not exist in the configuration template.

   The "operation-tag" metadata MUST have only one value to specify the
   intended operation.  The encoding of "operation-tag" metadata object
   follows the way defined in Section 5 of [RFC7952].

   For example, a client may want to delete the "description" node
   instance defined in Figure 1 for interface "eth1", and the following
   shows the example configuration:

<interfaces xmlns:template="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-template"
  template:stmt-extend="interface-type-mtu">
  <interface>
    <name>eth0</name>
  </interface>
  <interface>
    <name>eth1</name>
    <mtu>9122</mtu>
    <description template:operation-tag="delete">MTU value is set by template</description>
  </interface>
</interfaces>

   And it is equivalent to the following:

   <interfaces>
     <interface>
       <name>eth0</name>
       <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
       <mtu>1500</mtu>
       <description>MTU value is set by template</description>
     </interface>
     <interface>
       <name>eth1</name>
       <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
       <mtu>9122</mtu>
     </interface>
   </interfaces>

5.3.  List/leaf-list Reordering

   There may be a desire to reorder some existing list/leaf-list entries
   defined in an existing template, or specify the ordering of new
   instances when they are created.  It only applies to lists and leaf-
   lists indicated with the "ordered-by user" statement.

   The reordering of list/leaf-list entry data is flagged by declaring
   the metadata object called "operation-tag" with different values.
   The "operation-tag" used for reordering has one of the following
   values:

   position-first: The attached entry is positioned as the first entry
   in the list/leaf-list.  There must be no more than one entry that is
   annotated as "position-first" within the same operation request.

   position-last: The attached entry is positioned as the last entry in
   the list/leaf-list.  There must be no more than one entry that is
   annotated as "position-last" within the same operation request.

   position-before: The attached entry is positioned before some
   other specified

   entries in the list/leaf-list.  This value MUST be followed by one
   or more

   space-seperated key values to indicate the entries that the
   attached entry is

   just positioned before.  The "position-before" metadata and key
   values are

   seperated by colon ":".  There must not be any other entries that
   use

   "position-before" to target the entry attached as "position-first"
   within the

   same operation rquest.  position-after: The attached entry is
      positioned after some other specified entries in the list/leaf-
      list.  This value MUST be followed by one or more space-seperated
      key values to indicate the entries that the attached entry is just
      positioned after.  The "position-after" metadata and key values
      are seperated by colon ":".  There must not be any other entries
      that use "position-after" to target the entry attached as
      "position-last" within the same operation request.

   For example, the following template provides the user-ordered ACL
   configuration:

   <templates>
     <template>
       <id>ACL-rules-template</id>
       <acls>
         <acl>
           <name>allow-access-from-tcp</name>
           <matches>
             <protocol>tcp</protocol>
           </matches>
           <action>permit</action>
         </acl>
         <acl>
           <name>allow-access-from-udp</name>
           <matches>
             <protocol>udp</protocol>
           </matches>
           <action>permit</action>
         </acl>
       </acls>
     </template>
   </templates>

   If the client wants to create another template with an additional ACL
   entry named "deny-traffic-from-ftp" ordered as the first entry and
   ACL entry named "allow-access-from-tcp" as the last one:

   <templates>
     <template>
       <id>ACL-rules-template2</id>
       <acls xmlns:template="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-template"
         template:stmt-extend="acl-rule-template">
         <acl template:operation-tag="position-first">
           <name>deny-traffic-from-ftp</name>
           <matches>
             <protocol>ftp</protocol>
           </matches>
         </acl>
         <acl template:operation-tag="position-last">
           <name>allow-access-from-tcp</name>
         </acl>
       </acls>
     </template>
   </templates>

   The client may also deliver the configuration defined in template
   "acl-rule-template" with some other additional ACL entries that is
   properly ordered:

<acls xmlns:template="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-template"
  template:stmt-extend="acl-rule-template">
  <acl template:operation-tag="position-before:\
    'allow-access-from-tcp allow-access-from-udp'">
    <name>deny-access-to-ipv4</name>
    <matches>
      <destination-ipv4-network>192.0.2.0/24</destination-ipv4-network>
    </matches>
  </acl>
  <acl template:operation-tag="position-after:'deny-access-to-ipv4'">
    <name>deny-access-to-ipv6</name>
    <matches>
      <destination-ipv6-network>2001:db8::/32</destination-ipv6-network>
    </matches>
  </acl>
</acls>

   The applied ACL configuration is equivalent to the following:

<acls>
  <acl>
    <name>deny-access-to-ipv4</name>
    <matches>
      <destination-ipv4-network>192.0.2.0/24</destination-ipv4-network>
    </matches>
  </acl>
  <acl>
    <name>deny-access-to-ipv6</name>
    <matches>
      <destination-ipv6-network>2001:db8::/32</destination-ipv6-network>
    </matches>
  </acl>
  <acl>
    <name>allow-access-from-tcp</name>
    <matches>
      <protocol>tcp</protocol>
    </matches>
    <action>permit</action>
  </acl>
  <acl>
    <name>allow-access-from-udp</name>
    <matches>
      <protocol>udp</protocol>
    </matches>
    <action>permit</action>
  </acl>
</acls>

6.  Interaction with NMDA datastores

   Some implementation may have predefined configuration templates for
   the convenience of clients, which are present in <system> (if
   implemented, see [I-D.ietf-netmod-system-config]).  In addition,
   clients can always define their own templates in <running>.  However,
   configuration template data defined by "ietf-template" YANG data
   model should not be visible in <operational> until being inherited by
   a node in the data tree.

   If a node in the data tree inherits a configuration template, the
   configuration template does not expand in <running>, a read back of
   <running> returns what is sent by the client with the "stmt-extend"
   metadata attached to the specific node.  Configuration template which
   is inherited or overridden by the node instance MUST be expanded in
   <intended>.

      Editor's Note: The read-back of <running> might break legacy
      clients doesn't understand template?

7.  Different Levels of Templates

   The configuration templates may be defined at different levels,
   depending on where it is used and maintained.  For exmaple, A
   network-level template maintained by the software-defined networking
   (SDN) [RFC7149] [RFC7426] controller defines configuration that may
   be shared by multiple network devices.  While device-level template
   maintained by the network element defines configuration that can only
   be applied to specific network devices.  Refer to Appendix A for
   examples of network-level templates.

8.  The "ietf-template" YANG Module

8.1.  Data Model Overview

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "ietf-template"
   module:

        +--rw template* [id]
           +--rw id                 string
           +--rw description?       string
           +--rw content?           <anydata>
           +--ro last-modified?     yang:timestamp

Appendix A.  Usage Examples

   This section provides some examples to show the use of templates.
   JSON encodings are used to not imply a preference in this document.
   The fictional data model used throughout this section is shown as
   follows:

   module example-network-systime {
     yang-version 1.1;
     namespace "urn:example:network-system-time";
     prefix "ex-nesyst";

     import ietf-inet-types {
       prefix "inet";
     }

     list network-device {
       key device-id;
       leaf device-id {
         type string;
       }
       container ntp {
         leaf enabled {
           type boolean;
           mandatory true;
         }
         list server {
           ordered-by user;
           key name;
           leaf name {
             type string;
           }
           leaf-list alias {
             type string;
           }
           leaf address {
             type inet:host;
             mandatory true;
           }
           leaf port {
             type inet:port-number;
             default 123;
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

A.1.  Creating Templates

   The NTP configuration on multiple network devices may be consistent.
   To create a template for NTP configuration, the following template
   configuration might be sent to a SDN controller:

  {
      "ietf-templates:templates": {
          "template": [
              {
                  "id": "template-ntp",
                  "content": {
                      "network-device": [
                          {
                              "ntp": {
                                  "enabled": "true",
                                  "server": [
                                      {
                                          "name": "ntp-server-1",
                                          "alias": [
                                              "primary"
                                          ],
                                          "address": "ntp.example-1.com"
                                      },
                                      {
                                          "name": "ntp-server-2",
                                          "alias": [
                                              "secondary"
                                          ],
                                          "address": "ntp.example-2.com"
                                      }
                                  ]
                              }
                          }
                      ]
                  }
              }
          ]
      }
  }

A.2.  Inheriting Templates

   The operator may create another template with an additional NTP
   server instance when inheriting the template created in Appendix A.1.
   The configuration is shown as follows:

{
    "ietf-templates:templates": {
        "template": [
            {
                "id": "template-ntp2",
                "content": {
                    "network-device": [
                        {
                            "@": {
                                "ietf-template:stmt-extend": "template-ntp"
                            },
                            "ntp": {
                                "server": [
                                    {
                                        "name": "ntp-server-3",
                                        "alias": [
                                            "secondary"
                                        ],
                                        "address": "ntp.example-3.com"
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}

   The configuration of template "template-ntp2" is equivalent to the
   following:

 {
     "ietf-templates:templates": {
         "template": [
             {
                 "id": "template-ntp2",
                 "content": {
                     "network-device": [
                         {
                             "ntp": {
                                 "enabled": "true",
                                 "server": [
                                     {
                                         "name": "ntp-server-1",
                                         "alias": [
                                             "primary"
                                         ],
                                         "address": "ntp.example-1.com",
                                         "prefer": true
                                     },
                                     {
                                         "name": "ntp-server-2",
                                         "alias": [
                                             "secondary"
                                         ],
                                         "address": "ntp.example-2.com"
                                     },
                                     {
                                         "name": "ntp-server-3",
                                         "alias": [
                                             "secondary"
                                         ],
                                         "address": "ntp.example-3.com"
                                     }
                                 ]
                             }
                         }
                     ]
                 }
             }
         ]
     }
 }

   the following shows the network-level ntp configuration using
   "template-ntp" and "template-ntp2" that may be sent to a SDN
   controller:

   {
       "example-network-systime:network-device": [
           {
               "@": {
                   "ietf-template:stmt-extend": "template-ntp"
               },
               "device-id": "ne-0"
           },
           {
               "@": {
                   "ietf-template:stmt-extend": "template-ntp"
               },
               "device-id": "ne-1"
           },
           {
               "@": {
                   "ietf-template:stmt-extend": "template-ntp2"
               },
               "device-id": "ne-2"
           },
           {
               "@": {
                   "ietf-template:stmt-extend": "template-ntp2"
               },
               "device-id": "ne-3"
           }
       ]
   }

   And it is equivalent to the following configuration:

   {
       "example-network-systime:network-device": [
           {
               "device-id": "ne-0",
               "ntp": {
                   "enabled": "true",
                   "server": [
                       {
                           "name": "ntp-server-1",
                           "alias": [
                               "primary"

A.3.  Overriding Templates

   The client may override the template created in Appendix A.1 to
   specify the NTP server named "ntp-server-2" as the perferred one for
   device "ne-4":

 {
     "example-network-systime:network-device": [
         {
             "@": {
                 "ietf-template:stmt-extend": "template-ntp"
             },
             "device-id": "ne-4",
             "server": [
                 {
                     "name": "ntp-server-1",
                     "alias": [
                         "primary",
                         "secondary"
                     ],
                     "@alias": [
                         {
                             "ietf-template:operation-tag": "delete"
                         }
                     ],
                     "address": "ntp.example-1.com"
                 },
                 {
                     "@": {
                         "ietf-template:operation-tag": "position-first"
                     },
                     "name": "ntp-server-2",
                     "alias": [
                         "primary",
                         "secondary"
                     ],
                     "@alias": [
                         null,
                         {
                             "ietf-template:operation-tag": "delete"
                         }
                     ],
                     "address": "ntp.example-2.com"
                 }
             ]
         }
     ]
 }

   It is equivalent to the configuration as follows:

   {
       "example-network-systime:network-device": [
           {
               "device-id": "ne-4",
               "ntp": {
                   "enabled": "true",
                   "server": [
                       {
                           "name": "ntp-server-2",
                           "alias": [
                               "primary"
                           ],
                           "address": "ntp.example-2.com"
                       },
                       {
                           "name": "ntp-server-1",
                           "alias": [
                               "secondary"
                           ],
                           "address": "ntp.example-1.com"
                       }
                   ]
               }
           }
       ]
   }
